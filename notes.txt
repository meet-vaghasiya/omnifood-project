1. make default font size 62.5%. which convert 1 rem to 10px . so we can easily use rem all over paddding, margin , height , width,font size ...

2. use max-width instead of width for container and for responsive  design(desktop first)

3. use inset property in box shadow for inner show in elenemtn.

4. make seprate class for margin in button like margin-right-sm and give important because we use in multiple side so we  requried in some places.

5. we required only one propery height or width in images .broser automatic get another size. but in display:flex in saffari there is bug so use both property in display:flex in images.

6. for image overlap use negative margin.
