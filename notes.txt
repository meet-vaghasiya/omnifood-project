1. make default font size 62.5%. which convert 1 rem to 10px . so we can easily use rem all over paddding, margin , height , width,font size ...

2. use max-width instead of width for container and for responsive  design(desktop first)

3. use inset property in box shadow for inner show in elenemtn.

4. make seprate class for margin in button like margin-right-sm and give important because we use in multiple side so we  requried in some places.

5. we required only one propery height or width in images .broser automatic get another size. but in display:flex in saffari there is bug so use both property in display:flex in images.

6. for image overlap use negative margin.

7.main is new html5 semantic element. which is use for nor repetative content in diff page. like header and footer is same in all page.  so we should not put in main element. section is differnt in all pages so we 

8. we genrally not give height to the header. but if want to sticky navbar than give height. otherwise it's takes automatically from content.


9.<section>
    <div class="continer">
     code here...
    
    </div>

</section>

means give background colot to the section and give max-widtn and padding  to contaiener.so backgrond color remain all the width of screen. 

10. grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr and repeat(3,1fr)

11. hero section is wider than other for better visula effect. in out project other part width is 120rem but hero has width 130 rem . so we not use reusable grid in hero section.

12.there should be only one h1 element in all page
13. img tag does't have child element. so we can not use sudo element like img::before or img::after in img element.

14.gap-row and gap-column seprate proptery  availbale in grid.

15. step-img-box::before  here width 60% workinh but height is not working so use padding-bottom:60% .
